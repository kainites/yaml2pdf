C files cannot be executed, they must be compiled into an executable first.

For example:

Given a C file called "file.c"

Open a terminal
Use gcc for compile the file and make an executable gcc file.c -o executable
Run the executable file, by literally just typing ./executable


Relative paths are relative to the current working directory, not the path of the executable. 
The current working directory is the directory from which you started the program.
